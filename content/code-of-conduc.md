At wwktm we aim to create a **space for open communication and discussions**. Openness is not possible without respect and empathy. We strive to create an environment that is memorable for all the right reasons. Our event has inclusivity at its very heart, and this centers around treating all individuals with respect and tolerance, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity or religious views.

**Any form of harassment will not be tolerated at the conference**. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

**Sponsors and Speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy**. In particular, they should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or **expulsion from the conference** with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
